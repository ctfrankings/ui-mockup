The winners of said competitions have reserved seats at this years show. As always, pre-qualified teams that don't participate in quals should be ashamed by their weakness and apply to be a CEH or SANS instructor / cyber security poser. Depending on how these teams fare, future winners of these contests may or may not be invited again, so you bitches better represent!\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be fair to reduce the number of spots available to the public at large, so we're upping the number of tables in Vegas to 12 total.

To add to the fun, this years competition will feature a special new category that has never been seen before in any other CTF competition. We think you're going to love it!\r\n\r\nTo raise the level of competition another notch, this year will also be the first year that GitS CTF will be online so that hackers not attending ShmooCon can also participate in the event. However, most prizes will be limited to the teams that are playing onsite at the conference.\r\n\r\nTo get a feel for the type of questions you might come across, last year's challenges are online:  http://ghostintheshellcode.com\r\n\r\nJust to get the juices flowing the GitS CTF will be hosting another online warmup round. As before, the winning prize will be a coveted ShmooCon barcode.\r\n\r\nThe event will be kicking off at 6pm on January 6th, and will run into 6pm on January 7th, or until all challenges have been solved (last year all challenges were solved, so we thought that was a good excuse\r\nto add more this year).\r\n\r\nMore detail (as always) available at <a

All the vulnerabilities are not fictional, but indeed occur on contemporary information systems. Moreover, the format of PHDays CTF is really wide due to the game environment\u2019s saturation with unique elements (such as capturing and keeping control of the systems according to the King of the Hill principles, the option of solving game problems blindly \u2014 i.e. attacking systems without any access to them, etc.).

So we have. We are pre-qualifying winners of other CTFs around the globe to bring a smackdown of epic proportions this August.\r\n\r\nAs always, last year's champion, the Euopean Nopsled Team, is granted automatic entry. There are so many CTFs on the circuit these days, we seek to incorporate only the best of the best.\r\n\r\nSo, random, wandering sheep have selected the following CTFs using a scientifically proven \"pin the tail on the m3rc\" (role reversal--who knew?) method.\r\n\r\nLast year the iCTF and Codegate winners demonstrated that winners of these CTFs were worthy of returning, additionally we invite victors from NCCDC, HitB, PhDays, nuit du hack, RuCTFE, and Defcon 19 oCTF.\r\n\r\nThe winners of said competitions have reserved seats at this years show.\r\n\r\nWhile DEFCON refuses to sell-out to corporate sponsorship, DT is personally covering two rooms per team at the majestic RIO hotel Thursday-Sunday for each team.\r\n\r\nIn honor of DC XX we're upping the number of tables in Vegas to 20 total. Yes, when the dust clears the _20_ best will be invited to join us this summer in sin city for the annual DEFCON deathmatch. It wouldn't be fair to reduce the number of spots available to the public at large, so 10 teams will qualify in open quals this June.\r\n\r\nReg is at ddtek.biz. Only those that pre-register for quals are permitted entry. Each individual should register.

Submit the flags to obtain offensive points and also unlock nuclear weapons that can be launched against rival teams. For defensive points, all the team had to do was to keep their daemons up and running.\r\nFallout Apocalypse will require each team to manage a nuclear power plant and protect their daemons, which represents the reactor\u2019s cores, from attacks while at the same time launch attacks against rival teams\u2019 nuclear reactor. Weaponized SCADA exploits can be used to cause monetary damage towards rival teams. Fallout Apocalypse will also feature a spanking new black market where teams may trade exploits and also purchase countermeasures.\r\nDETAILED EXPLANATION\r\nEach team will start with an equal amount of money which represents their points. More money can be obtained periodically by making sure daemons are all up and running during a flag check initiated by the score server. Money can also be obtained by achieving \u201cBreak through Points\u201d, which will be awarded to the first team who manages to solve a daemon, or in other words, be the first to steal a flag via a particular daemon.\r\nBy solving a daemon, not only will the team be awarded with points, the team will also be awarded with a Weaponized SCADA exploit that can be launched against a rival team. There will be a total of ten (10) daemons all together, hence ten (10) weaponized SCADA exploits available for each team to acquire. No extra points will be awarded to the team that launches it, however monetary damage will be inflicted against the target team. If a team\u2019s money reaches zero (0), the team will automatically be kicked out of the competition. Keep in mind that each weaponized SCADA exploit may only be used once. Depending on the difficulty of exploitation of the daemon, each weaponized SCADA exploit will carry a different damage rating.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Fallout Apocalypse will feature a Black Market where teams can conveniently purchase items from the shop and also trade exploits amongst each other.  Items such as protection and countermeasures can be purchased while on the other hand, teams who wish to auction off their exploits can do so via a broker (The CTF Crew). The owner of the exploit will inform the broker of starting price and the broker will auction it off to the highest bidder. The profit obtained from the purchase will be added to the seller\u2019s pot of gold (total points).\r\nAt the end of the competition, the team with the most money (total points) will be crowned as the winner. Hence, teams will need to make sure their daemons are up and running and also harvest flags from time to time for more points. Flags are changed periodically to allow teams to obtain more points by harvesting flags. The CTF network will be isolated from the rest of the conference network, and we will NOT provide Internet on the CTF network.

There will be daemons running on the servers. Some daemons are puzzle-based challenges and some contain vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow, format string and so on. \r\n\r\nThe teams\u2019 objective is to analyze the daemons, find vulnerabilities and write exploits. A working exploit will enable the team to attack other teams' servers, retrieving the flag associated with each daemon running on the server and thus scoring an offensive point. The ability to keep the daemons running will enable the teams to score a defensive point. \r\n\r\nScoring\r\n========================\r\n\r\nOffensive Points = Gained by hacking into other team\u2019s server and retrieving their flags.\r\n\r\nDefensive Points = Gained by keeping your server\u2019s daemons running.\r\n\r\nChallenge Points = Gained by submit the correct flags for challenges\r\n\r\nTotal points = offensive points + defensive points + challenge points\r\n\r\nIn order to score an offensive point, all that a team needs to do is hack into other team\u2019s server, retrieve the flag, and submit it to the score server. In order to get a defensive score, teams must keep their daemons running and accessible by the crew. Flag checks will be done randomly. If a flag check fails, teams will not gain a defensive point. Flags will be reset randomly as well, thus teams are allowed to harvest flags to gain more offensive points.\r\n\r\nHigher points are given for offensive attacks as opposed to defensive scores. Defensive scores are the same for all daemons while offensive scores vary depending on the complexity level of the exploit needed. The first team able to exploit the daemon will gain a \u2018breakthrough point\u2019.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the competition, the team with highest total points will be the one who rules the world! In case of two different teams having the same points, whichever team is quickest to reach the highest points will be declared the winner.

The PwnTillDawn \u201cCapture-the-flag\u201d (CTF) will challenge contestants to break into as many machines as possible using a succession of weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Upon the compromise of a machine, contestants will have to collect flags awarding a certain amount of points.\r\n\r\nGoodwill Event Edition Changes \r\n\r\nThis edition of the PwnTillDawn competition will be slightly different from the previous ones, in fact, you will not only participate for yourself but also you will help less fortunate young students to get Cyber Security trainings.\r\n\r\nWhen the total of the points from the flags discovered by the participants will reach different thresholds (based on the number of players) a training will be granted! We are counting on you to discover as many flags as possible so we can give away all the trainings!\r\n \r\nNew Addition -> TEAMS\r\nFor this Goodwill edition of the PwnTillDawn we are also releasing a new feature: TEAMS.\r\nA maximum of 3 players can join a team and participate to the Goodwill Competition.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nDue to limited spots available for the competition, registrations will undergo a selection process where your passion, motivation, and experience for offensive security will be assessed.

The radio signals will be distributed \"over IP\". The use of IP eliminates the complexity of deploying actual radios and transmitting RF over the air.

Players will attack a single Linux target, we\u2019ve spread prizes out across 15 teams, and the Metasploit Framework teams have devised a variety of challenges that aim to help infosec newcomers build practical skills. While there are some challenges that are intended to be a bit more difficult, we\u2019ve designed the majority of them for beginner audiences. Hint: We\u2019ve arranged challenges by port number according to difficulty this year. The higher the port number, the harder the challenge. If you want to start out with easier challenges, start by targeting services that run on lower port numbers.\r\nAs always, teams are encouraged!

The challenge covers every corner of the information security field: application vulnerabilities, network and Web weaknesses, physical vulnerabilities, flaws in systems, etc. In the end, an intelligent and smart system will count each team\u2019s score, and winners will eventually get remarkable prizes.", "format": "Jeopardy", "is_votable_now": false, "prizes": "1st place  : 20000 MAD\r\n2nd place : 15000 MAD\r\n3rd place  : 10000 MAD", "format_id": 1, "onsite": true, "restrictions": "Open", "url": "http://mcsc.ma/", "public_votable": false}, {"organizers": [{"id": 19098, "name": "Octosec"}], "ctftime_url": "https://ctftime.org/event/1650/", "ctf_id": 787, "weight": 0.00, "duration": {"hours": 7, "days": 0}, "live_feed": "", "logo": "https://ctftime.org//media/events/b12d6b9d44cb4eaeb19939bb4c4ecf27.png", "id": 1650, "title": "Hacktrick CTF'22", "start": "2022-05-27T10:00:00+00:00", "participants": 8, "location": "Turkey, Ankara, Bilgi Teknolojileri ve \u0130leti\u015fim Kurumu, ", "finish": "2022-05-27T17:00:00+00:00", "description": "", "format": "Hack quest", "is_votable_now": false, "prizes": "", "format_id": 3, "onsite": true, "restrictions": "Open", "url": "https://hacktrickconf.com/", "public_votable": false}, {"organizers": [{"id": 155711, "name": "BYU Cyberia"}], "ctftime_url": "https://ctftime.org/event/1660/", "ctf_id": 768, "weight": 20.91, "duration": {"hours": 12, "days": 1}, "live_feed": "", "logo": "https://ctftime.org//media/events/redCoug.JPG", "id": 1660, "title": "BYUCTF 2022", "start": "2022-05-27T16:00:00+00:00", "participants": 132, "location": "", "finish": "2022-05-29T04:00:00+00:00", "description": "A CTF hosted by BYU Cyberia- A CTF Team at BYU. \r\n\r\nChallenges will be geared towards beginners, with topics such as Web, Crypto, OSINT, Forensics, Reverse Engineering and more. \r\n\r\nStart date: 05/27/2022 10am MST\r\nEnd Date: 05/28/2022 10pm MST\r\nJeopardy Style, Open to teams with no size limit. \r\nOnline", "format": "Jeopardy", "is_votable_now": false, "prizes": "", "format_id": 1, "onsite": false, "restrictions": "Open", "url": "https://byu.ctfd.io/", "public_votable": true}, {"organizers": [{"id": 145166, "name": "HeroCTF"}], "ctftime_url": "https://ctftime.org/event/1663/", "ctf_id": 601, "weight": 24.23, "duration": {"hours": 2, "days": 2}, "live_feed": "", "logo": "https://ctftime.org//media/events/HeroCTF_icon_400x.png", "id": 1663, "title": "HeroCTF v4", "start": "2022-05-27T21:00:00+00:00", "participants": 136, "location": "", "finish": "2022-05-29T23:00:00+00:00", "description": "- Online\r\n- Beginner to advanced players\r\n- All categories (web, pwn, reverse, forensics, stegano, ...)\r\n- Teams of 4", "format": "Jeopardy", "is_votable_now": false, "prizes": "Students french prize pool :\r\n > Proxmark 3 RDV4.01 (x4)\r\n > Ledger Nano X (x4)\r\n > Ledger Nano S (x4)\r\n > Hackthebox Pro Lab (1 month) (x4)\r\n > Lockpicking kit (x4)\r\n > Anti-RFID wallet (x4)\r\n\r\nStudents foreign prize pool :\r\n > Hackthebox VIP (1 year) (x4)\r\n > TryHackMe VIP (6 month) (x4)\r\n > TryHackMe VIP (3 month) (x4)\r\n\r\nhttps://ctf.heroctf.fr/about", "format_id": 1, "onsite": false, "restrictions": "Open", "url": "https://ctf.heroctf.fr/", "public_votable": true}, {"organizers": [{"id": 181536, "name": "Nautilus Institute"}], "ctftime_url": "https://ctftime.org/event/1661/", "ctf_id": 1, "weight": 77.83, "duration": {"hours": 0, "days": 2}, "live_feed": "https://ctftime.org/live/1661/", "logo": "", "id": 1661, "title": "DEF CON CTF Qualifier 2022", "start": "2022-05-28T00:00:00+00:00", "participants": 107, "location": "", "finish": "2022-05-30T00:00:00+00:00", "description": "On-line, open-registration, Jeopardy-style, registration is at https://quals.2022.nautilus.institute/\r\n\r\nFinals schedule is from August 12-14 at DEF CON in Las Vegas.", "format": "Jeopardy", "is_votable_now": false, "prizes": "", "format_id": 1, "onsite": false, "restrictions": "Open", "url": "https://quals.2022.nautilus.institute/", "public_votable": true}, {"organizers": [{"id": 3208, "name": "HackingForSoju"}], "ctftime_url": "https://ctftime.org/event/1669/", "ctf_id": 152, "weight": 25.00, "duration": {"hours": 1, "days": 1}, "live_feed": "", "logo": "https://ctftime.org//media/events/secfest.png", "id": 1669, "title": "Security Fest 2022", "start": "2022-06-02T10:00:00+00:00", "participants": 30, "location": "", "finish": "2022-06-03T11:00:00+00:00", "description": "Security Fest is an annual IT-security conference in Gothenburg, Sweden.

However, this year the CTF will have a stronger focus on the onsite visitors of MCH2022. The CTF contains multiple beginner and intermediate challenges, and is also suitable if you have never played a CTF before. It further contains on-site challenges which you can find in the CTF tent, where you can also get some help with the challenges or play together with other players.\r\n\r\nWhile online players are invited to join the CTF as well, we focus on the on-site players including on-site-only challenges. Since learning is more important than winning, we allow beginning players to work together and get help from experienced CTF players in the CTF tent. Players who actively participate in the CTF tent are also given some snacks and a drink to keep them going.\r\n\r\nCheck the map to see where you can find us on the campground and good luck in the CTF! \r\n\r\nYou can find more information on the CTF on the CTF website: https://ctf.mch2022.org\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter for news and information: https://twitter.com/mch2022ctf\r\n\r\nJoin our Discord for news and if you have any questions, need help or want to meet other CTF players: https://discord.gg/fkn7qW3GRT", "format": "Jeopardy", "is_votable_now": false, "prizes": "", "format_id": 1, "onsite": true, "restrictions": "Open", "url": "https://ctf.mch2022.org/", "public_votable": true}, {"organizers": [{"id": 109452, "name": "DiceGang"}], "ctftime_url": "https://ctftime.org/event/1706/", "ctf_id": 331, "weight": 47.77, "duration": {"hours": 0, "days": 2}, "live_feed": "", "logo": "https://ctftime.org//media/events/dicehope.png", "id": 1706, "title": "DiceCTF @ HOPE 2022", "start": "2022-07-22T18:00:00+00:00", "participants": 27, "location": "USA, New York City", "finish": "2022-07-24T18:00:00+00:00", "description": "Win US$2,000 in prizes from DiceCTF @ HOPE 2022, a cybersecurity competition by DiceGang at the HOPE conference!\r\n", "format": "Jeopardy", "is_votable_now": false, "prizes": "1st place: US$1,000\r\n2nd place: US$600\r\n3rd place: US$400\r\n\r\nYou must have at least one in-person participant to be eligible for prizes!

This is your chance to join the biggest hacking competition of the year, powered by Hack The Box.\r\n\r\n66 Million Years Ago\u2026\r\nAll started million years ago in a distant plannet, home to a parasitic alien species. Their plannet was threatened by a black hole and were searching solutions to survive. Therefore the aliens sent out organized missions, containing their offspring that would travel in space until hitting a planet suitable for them. Once they land on one, they would drill underground and hibernate until they were awakened. One of these vessels hit and established itself on Earth. However the hit was so massive it caused an extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs. \r\n\r\nThousands of Years Ago\u2026\r\nIn one of those missions, In 3000 B.C., a spaceship crashed into Earth. The surviving crew was outnumbered and defeated by the tribes of ancient Egypt. Only one alien member managed to ran away wcith a very powerful treasure. This treasure is holding the power to awaken their kind, and infinite capabilities to anyone holding it.  Despite that, the alien never made it to the spaceship and died in the desert. Generations later, the son of a Pharaoh stumbles on a strange skeleton, holding on to a piece of alien technology. He found a way to harness some of the immense power of this relic. He grew mad with power, oppressed his people and conquered neighboring nations. The people detested their leader, and when he died, he was buried along with the artifact in an underground city and was never spoken of again.\r\n\r\nIn the Distant Future\u2026\r\nThe Intergalactic Ministry of Spies has captured and decoded communications channels hinting that the aliens have already made it again to Earth and are trying to find information regarding the relic. The ministry contacted Pandora, a famous archaeologist hacker, to help them get to the powerful artifact before the aliens. She will have to race against time and navigate treacherous ancient tombs and underground cities to locate the relic. She will face rival treasure hunters and possible lifeforms of unknown origin. Will she be the first to find the artifact and save humanity?\r\n\r\nJoin, compete, meet, and learn from the best hackers in the world.

This concept ensures that teams can practice and test their skills and abilities without risking and compromising real information resources.\r\n\r\nIn \"HolmCity\" Hackathon participants gain experience in conducting attacks and defense in cyberspace without harming real ICT systems.\r\n\r\nThe Hackathon is an excellent opportunity to test the teams ability in dealing with real threats, as well as to create new knowledge and skills that are needed to protect ICT systems and services in a modern and contemporary environment.\r\n\r\nExcercise is ideal for organizations that want to test their teams in the field of cyber security, as well as for individuals who want to improve their knowledge and skills in this area.\r\n\r\nHackathon is a team game that requires the whole team to coordinate activities in order to achieve the best possible result. Quick reaction, good communication and a clear strategy are just some of the many factors that affect the successful fight with other teams in capturing and winning the ICT resources in the virtual city \"HolmCity\" and finally winning the throne.\r\n\r\nTeams in the virtual city \"HolmCity\" perform both attack and defense on ICT infrastructure and services. Each team has up to 5 members. In addition to the machines available to team members, the team also has its own ICT infrastructure that it must defend against attacks from other teams. As any other city \"HolmCity\" has public services that are vulnerable to attacks by all teams.\r\n\r\nOn the attack side, teams need to discover vulnerabilities on services and machines in the ICT infrastructure defended by other teams as well as on machines and services in the public area of \u200b\u200b\"HolmCity\", and then exploit them and raise a flag. The raising of the flag is done by starting a script that signals which team has won the goal and from that moment points are awarded to that team.\r\n\r\nOn the defense side, teams need to patch existing vulnerabilities in their own ICT infrastructure and in the public services of \"HolmCity\", in order to protect their raised flags from being taken down by another team.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the Hackathon for the team is to occupy as many resources as possible, to raise as many of their own flags as possible in the ICT infrastructure of other teams as well as in the public part of \"HolmCity\", and to defend them as long as possible from attacks by other teams. When one team takes advantage of a vulnerability on a machine and notices that a flag has been raised, it knocks it down and raises its own, since then the points go to the team that raised the flag. The team that lost the flag will lose points.\r\n\r\nThe Hackathon in the virtual city \"HolmCity\" not only tests the technical skills of the team and the individual, but also psychophysical strength because its duration is 4 hours, where at the same time the team members cooperate with each other, share tasks and solve various problems.\r\n\r\nUpon registration of the participating the organizer of the Hackathon provides access to materials for preparation for participation, and three days before the start of the conference provides access to the infrastructure in the virtual city \"HolmCity\" so that the team can become more familiar with the environment and prepare for defense.\r\n\r\nThe Hackathon takes place on May 25, 2023, during the Nordic IT Security conference, with the mandatory physical presence of all team members. Nordic IT Security provides valuable prizes for the first three places and consolation prizes for the other places.\r\n\r\nBasic Rules\r\n\r\nGeneral rules of participation in the Hackathon in the virtual city \"HolmCity\" are:\r\n\r\n\u2022Teams start with 0 points.\r\n\r\n\u2022 An attack on the ICT infrastructure of other teams and the public part of the virtual city \"HolmCity\" is allowed. It is not allowed to attack teams user machines and system services (IP ranges and addresses will be specified in the materials for access and participation). A team that violates this rule will be disqualified.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Use the original scripts obtained from the organizers to raise the flags.

Time to leave the planet.\r\nEighty years ago, Earth faced a crisis like never before. Fossil fuels had been exhausted, water was scarce, and power a luxury.

These 80 years of dispute stayed in history as the Dark War. \r\n\r\nNow, 16 years after the Armistice, warface is about to re-emerge. Scientists have confirmed an alternative power source on Mars \u2013 Vitalium \u2013 and the two states are now racing to establish a colony on the red planet. A ruthless competition of hacking and cyber-attacks has begun, and both sides are trying to damage and exploit each other's infrastructure. \r\n\r\nYou're part of the United Nations of Zenium, and your state wants to create a democratic colony where Vitalium will be used to make humanity healthy again.

It consists of two stages: online preliminaries and offline finals. Contestants will compete in a Jeopardy-style format using the competition platform provided by the organizers. The online preliminaries will be conducted using the Android emulator environment, while the offline finals will involve the use of actual Android devices.\r\n\r\nThe organizers have intentionally embedded identical or similar vulnerabilities in different versions of the Android system and will provide the vulnerability information to the contestants. Contestants will need to exploit the pre-embedded vulnerabilities to obtain flags.\r\n\r\nThe online preliminaries are scheduled to take place on August 26, 2023, at 10:00 AM (UTC+8) and end at August 28, 2023, at 10:00 AM(UTC+8), which will last for 48 hours.\r\n\r\nThe AVSS Contest provides challenges for cybersecurity enthusiasts of all levels. Beginners can get their feet wet with our introductory events, while experts can test their skills against our advanced scenarios. Our range of difficulty ensures an engaging experience for participants at any point in their cybersecurity journey. \r\n\r\nThis contest is the perfect opportunity to develop new skills, pursue your cybersecurity passions, and connect with others in the community.

The artifact maintains the balance between the mortal world and the realm of dragons, ensuring mutual respect and coexistence.\r\nHowever, whispers of discontent echo through the mountains and forests. Lord Malakar, a once-honorable knight turned warlord, becomes obsessed with the legends of old, seeking power beyond mortal means.

He begins a campaign of conquest, using fear and force to bend kingdoms to his will. The skies darken with dragon wings, and flames consume villages as resistance crumbles.\r\nAmidst the chaos, fate weaves together a diverse group of adventurers, each affected by Malakar's tyranny in personal ways.

Than say group A will have to teach or explain to group b a certain challenge randomly chosen. Now if group B manages to solve it they are still allowed to keep competing. If they don\u2019t manage to solve it they won\u2019t be allowed to continue the competition. This method encourages peer based learning. \r\nA physical presence unique event not only on the way the ctf takes place, but unique cause it's only one stage so no qualifiers.\r\n\r\nEvent will contain embedded pwn(arduino pwn+ re),space hacking(kudos to EthosLabsLLC), mainframe hacking(special thanks to soldier of fortran), bomb defusal, normal pwn, web, crypto ,forensics, powerpc,ic(cmos) revese engineering, nday development, docker escape, and car hacking, ics&scada(shoutout i0.rs group), browser pwn.

Here\u2019s what we know: \r\n\r\nWe are getting strange readings from around the city; there were some targeted attacks on local businesses that seemed off. Who was chosen and the type of attack piqued Holmes\u2019 interest, so he set out ahead of us. \r\n\r\nOdd though\u2026 he was muttering about something that had happened a while back, and he expressed distress about a personal AI he developed named WATSON. \r\n\r\nSee, WATSON was his collaborative ally in his attempts to curb the crime happening around the city. However, some time ago, a catastrophic false-alert event caused by WATSON triggered a year-long manhunt for a breach that never existed. We were chasing ghosts.  \r\n\r\nReputations ruined. Careers ended. The entire city was paralyzed over a phantom that was in our own backyard. The event known as NULLINC caused Holmes to shut down his creation, his friend. \r\n\r\nSo, we are just as confused about why he\u2019d mention WATSON now, but you never can get a read on that man. \r\n\r\nHead out into the field and assist him in finding out what\u2019s going on.

Than say group A will have to teach or explain to group b a certain challenge randomly chosen. Now if group B manages to solve it they are still allowed to keep competing. If they don\u2019t manage to solve it they won\u2019t be allowed to continue the competition.
